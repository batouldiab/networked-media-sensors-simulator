                       1. Abstract

                       This protocol is designed to regulate the communication of a data
                       server and a group of sensors corresponding to the coverage zone,
                       its capacity,
                       its resolution and other descriptors.
                       It also describes the format of the data that is exchanged between
                       the data server and the sensor.



                       2. Introduction

                       The data transmission protocol is intended for the use among several
                       interconnected systems where data is utilized and adapted to be
                       distributed on targeted sensors.


                       3. The Architecture

                       The data transmission protocol architectural model is a collection
                       of a data server and several sensors.
                       Data server executes applications that stream data.
                       Network elements are data server, tier1 sensors and tier2 sensors
                       which have management agents responsible for performing the network
                       management functions requested by the network management station
                       (sink).
                       The Data Transmission Protocol (DTP) is used to format data streamed
                       from
                       data servers to sensors.



                       4. Elements of the Architecture

                         I- Sensor: Receives streamed data
                         II- The Server: Streams data


                       5. Protocol Specification

                       5.1. Operation


                       When the sensor is generated with an id, allocated zone, capacity
                       and resolution it sends the streaming request over TCP connection to
                       the data server.

                       The data server saves the info of this sensor and starts streaming
                       data over UDP connection to the sensor corresponding to its coverage
                       zone, its capacity and its resolution.

                       The sensor stores the data received from the data server in a buffer
                       with the time it was received.

                       To make sure that the sensor is still operating, the sensor sends
                       each predefined period an availability packet to the data server.

                       In case the descriptors (idle, zone, capacity, etc...) of the sensor
                       changed, it sends a changing request to the data server, which in
                       turn edits the data and adapts the data streamed to the sensor with
                       the new modifications.


                       5.2. Packet structure

                       I- Streaming Request Packet
                          Request:id{any
                       integer}:idle{0,1}:zone{x,y,width,height}:capacity{frames per
                       second}:resolution{width,height}
                       II- Data Streaming Packet
                          Time{minutes,seconds,milliseconds}:Data{matrix}
                       III- Change Packet
                          Change:id{any
                       integer}:idle{0,1}:zone{x,y,width,height}:capacity{frames per
                       second}:resolution{width,height}
                       IV- Still Alive Packet
