                       1. Abstract

                       This RFC describes a protocol for exchanging data between the
                       supervisor server, sensors, and sink.



                       2. Introduction

                       The supervision protocol is intended for the use among
                       interconnected systems
                       to be able to record the network sensors that will be ”started” and
                       organize the works between the network elements.
                       It also con.gures and supervises a particular sensor, to transmit a
                       request by the sink or
                       to retrieve the result ···) or to ”play” a prede.ned scenario
                       described in advance in a form of a .le.


                       3. The Architecture

                       This protocol consists of a supervisor and a group of network
                       elements (sensors and server).
                       It's responsible for the management of roles and different
                       parameters among the elements.
                       Backup-ing is also done in the supervisor, which can handle the
                       failure of itself.


                       4. Elements of the Architecture

                         I- Supervisor: Sensors Managing server
                         II- Sink: Base request managing server
                         III- Sensors: zone-allocated sensors


                       5. Protocol Specification

                       5.1. Operation

                       When Sensors are created they will send their its descriptors
                       (information about its condition and its capabilities:  if it is
                       idle or not, what is the area of the scene it covers, what is the
                       frequency to refresh its image, what is its availability -i.e. the
                       load of work he is doing-, what is his actual communication rate,
                       etc…) to the Server.
                       If a request arrived to the sink with an unavailable zone, it
                       consequently sends a request to the supervisor to increase the zone
                       of a certain sensor. Once it does that, it replies to the sink with
                       a success/failure message. The sink in turn will just wait for the
                       update message to arrive from the sensor (if directly connected) or
                       from its parent.

                       The Server in turn, allocates Parents for these Sensors where each
                       parent can hold several capacities, then it sends for each Sensor
                       its parent and the sink IP (in case of the parent's failure) and for
                       each Parent its Sensors.

                       Each time a Sensor is created, the Server checks all the Parents and
                       add this Sensor to the Parent having an available capacity. If all
                       Parents are full (carrying full capacity), the Server will
                       temporarily allocate the direct IP addresses of the sink to this
                       sensor till a new parent arrives or a parent become available to
                       receive this sensor.

                       At the time of the creation of server, the supervisor also allocates
                       for this sensor the IP of the data server.

                       The Sensor will create a Remote Object and binds it to the RMI
                       registry.
                       The Server holds all Sensor's information (parent reference, id,
                       idle, zone, capacity and resolution).

                       The Server checks each unit of time if the Parents and the sensors
                       are still available or killed. If any Parent is killed, it will
                       allocate its Sensors to a new Parent and updates the data. If any
                       Sensor is killed, it will be deleted from the data.

                       The Supervisor auto-generates a backup-supervisor which receives a
                       predefined-period acknowledgement from the original supervisor.

                       If a predefined-period (slightly larger than the acknowledgement
                       period; considering an unexpected network traffic) passed with no
                       acknowledgement, backup supervisor considers that the old supervisor
                       failed broadcasting its IP to all sensors in network then generates
                       new backup-supervisor.
