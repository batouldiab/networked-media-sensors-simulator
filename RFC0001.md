                         1. Abstract

                         This RFC describes an existing protocol for the format of data that
                       is exchanged between the sensors of different tiers and same tiers in
                       the network, whether to transmit descriptors, requests, responses, or
                       optimize traffic, routing, etc...


                         2. Introduction

                         The communication protocol is intended for the use among several
                       interconnected systems where data is transferred and adapted between
                       sensors.


                         3. The Architecture

                         The communication protocol architectural model is a collection of a
                       sink and several sensors. The sink is the client root which receives
                       the main request.
                         Network elements are the sink, tier1 sensors and tier2 sensors which
                       have  management  agents  responsible  for  performing  the  network
                       management functions requested by the network management station
                       (sink).
                         The Communication Protocol (CP) is used to organize the sink-sensors
                       and sensors-sensors communication.


                         4. Elements of the Architecture

                         I- Sink: Main Request Handler
                         II- Sensor: Receives streamed data and adapt it according to its
                       functioning level
                       

                         5. Protocol Specification

                         5.1. Routing

                         When a TIER 1 sensor is generated, it sends to its parents its
                       descriptors (information about its condition and its capabilities: if
                       it is idle or not, what is the area of the scene it covers, what is
                       the frequency to refresh its image, what is its availability (i.e. the
                       load of work he is doing), what is his actual communication rate,
                       etc..).

                         When a TIER 2 sensor is generated, it broadcasts to all TIER 2 sensors
                       and the its parent its descriptors (information about its condition
                       and its capabilities:
                         if it is idle or not, what is the geographical area it covers, what
                       is the area of the scene it covers, what is the frequency to refresh
                       its image, what is its availability (i.e. the load of work he is
                       doing),
                         what is his actual communication rate, etc..)

                         When the parent receives the descriptors from the sensor, it
                       registers its routing table containing all the descriptors of this
                       sensor,
                         then it sends an updating message containing the new allocated zone
                       until the update message reach the sink.

                         The sink in its turn contains the routing table with the descriptors
                       of his children (directly connected sensors- TIER 2).
                         The sink auto-generates a backup-sink which waits a predefined-period
                       ack.  When  this  backup  stops  receiving  this  acknowledgment,  it
                       broadcasts its IP to all sensors and the supervisor.

                         In case a tier 2 sensor died, its children -if exist- send their
                       descriptors to the sink and the sink adopt them. (based on the request
                       in the project description)


                         5.2. Request/Response Handling

                         When the client orders a zone-data, it will create an agent, and
                       sends its agent as a parameter to the sink.
                         The sink looks-up in the routing table for the sensors that can
                       handle the request (zone, availability, idle, etc...).
                         If the request can't be handled by one sensor, it splits the request
                       so it can be handled by multiple sensors.


                         When the Parent receives the request from the sink, it will check
                       which Sensors cover the required zone.
                         If more than one Sensor covers this zone, the Parent will choose the
                       one that is not busy and the request will be sent there.
                         If the request can't be handled by one sensor, it splits the request
                       so it can be handled by multiple sensors.
                         When the request arrives, the sensor responds with the data and sends
                       it back to the Parent.
                         If the request was split the parent waits for the rest of the responds
                       to be received to combine them then send them to his parent.
                         The same process occurs at each level till the respond reaches the
                       sink.

                         Each unit of time, the Parent checks if it's Sensors are still
                       available or killed. If any is killed, it will delete it from the list
                       containing its own Sensors and informs its parent sensors. on the other
                       hand, if the sensor didn't receive the availability check request from
                       the  parent  during  a  unit  of  time  (slightly  larger  than  the
                       acknowledgment period; considering an unexpected network traffic), it
                       will assume that the parent is no longer available and will inform the
                       sink which will adopt them.

                         If a sensor of TIER 2 got overloaded, it communicates with the sensors
                       at the same level to find a sensor that can adopt its overloaded
                       children.

                         If a TIER 2 sensor is busy and a child wanted to respond, this sensor
                       of TIER 2 searches for an available sensor at its level and sends its
                       IP to the child.
